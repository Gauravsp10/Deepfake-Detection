# Deepfake-Detection
## 1. Introduction
This project focuses on detecting video deepfakes using advanced deep learning techniques, specifically ResNeXt and LSTM. By leveraging transfer learning, a pretrained ResNeXt CNN extracts feature vectors from video frames, which are then analyzed by an LSTM layer to capture temporal inconsistencies. This approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of deepfake detection.
## 2.  Model_Creation   
This directory includes a step-by-step workflow for building and training the deepfake detection model using ResNeXt and LSTM.
